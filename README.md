1.I have created 3 below classes.
a.Finder
b.FinderMain
c.FinderTest
2.With the help of Finder class whole business logic is written and inside FinderMain class I have call find() method of Finder class to test the functionality.
i.e input-finder.find('sad')` //sad,mkl
output -Final Output::[asd, ads]
3.Inside the FinderTest class I have write the test case to check the functionality.
4.I have created the sample.json to test the expected and actual result of test case.
