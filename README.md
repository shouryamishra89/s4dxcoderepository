1.I have created 3 below classes.
a.Finder
b.FinderMain
c.FinderTest
2.With the help of Finder class whole business logic is written and inside FinderMain class is the only responsible to run the application and I have call find() method of Finder class to test the functionality.
Input value like:sad,mkl (input-finder.find("sad")`)
i.e : Please Enter InputValue::
sad
Final Output::[asd, ads]

3.Inside the FinderTest class I have write the test case to check the functionality.
4.I have created the sample.json to test the expected and actual result of test case.
